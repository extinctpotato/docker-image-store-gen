# docker-image-store-gen

This repository contains the code of `disg`, which is a thin wrapper around the internals of [Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby).
Its main purpose is to facilitate the aggregation of Docker images which were exported as tar archives into a single archive containing the Docker data partition.
